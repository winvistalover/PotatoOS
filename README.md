# PotatoOS
A unix-like operating system made in C.
It's not quite unix-like *yet*. But we're getting there.

# Build PotatoOS
Just install qemu and i686-elf-gcc, then run `sh build.sh` and that's pretty much it

## Install qemu and i686-elf-gcc
```bash
pacman -S qemu
yay -S i686-elf-gcc
```
Atleast I think, I forgot what commands I used lol.
